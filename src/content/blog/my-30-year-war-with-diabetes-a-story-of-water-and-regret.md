I hope this story finds only those who love Korea, or those who are searching for a truth that feels real. I suspect many who read this may not believe it. And thatâ€™s okay... For the last 30 years, this has been my reality. Today, I will share a small part of it.

![A shocking photo of a severely inflamed and swollen foot, indicative of a serious infection.](/diabetes-story/1-diabetic-foot-infection-2018.jpg "The 2018 photo of my foot, on the verge of amputation.")

In April 2018, lying in a hospital bed, I heard words from my doctor that felt utterly unreal: "You need to be prepared to have your toe amputated."

I was so stunned that all I could manage was a faint, "Okay..." His expression wasn't a warning or a motivational tactic; it was the grave look of a man stating a medical probability. The seriousness in his eyes told me this was no longer a nightmare I could wake up from. It was real.

And I had proof of that reality right on my own body. The toe in question, on my right foot, was swollen to the point of bursting. The pain had started three days prior, a throbbing agony I had foolishly ignored until it became unbearable, leaving me sleepless and writhing in pain.

The cause of this catastrophe was... almost comically trivial.

![A 2018 medical chart showing a diagnosis of 'Cellulitis, foot, Rt.' and 'R/O DM foot,' with photos of the infected foot.](/diabetes-story/2-medical-chart-cellulitis-diagnosis-2018.jpg "The official diagnosis: Cellulitis and Diabetic Foot. The cause was a tiny, unnoticed scrape.")

A few days before being hospitalized, I had lightly bumped the front of my toe while wearing socks. It was so minor I can't even recall where it happened. The problem was what I did next... I went to a public bathhouse, completely unaware that the tiny friction had likely created a microscopic break in my skin.

For a healthy person, this would be of no consequence. But for someone with a blood sugar level consistently in the 300s-400s, it's an open invitation for disaster. The warm waters became an incubator for bacteria. The pain began subtly that evening. Had I just applied a simple antiseptic then... none of this would have happened. But I was arrogant. I thought, "It will be fine."

By the second day, the swelling and pain intensified. I finally applied some ointment. But it was far, far too late. The infection was already raging. The pain was excruciating... a feeling like my toe was trying to tear itself from my foot. By the time I arrived at the hospital, the infection was already advancing up my calf.

### Part 1: A 30-Year History of Denial

When did this all begin? My first official diagnosis was about 25 years ago, around 2001. I was constantly fatigued and experiencing extreme drowsiness after meals. A doctor gave me the news: my blood sugar was so high that hospitalization should be considered.

To me, in my 20s, "diabetes" was an abstraction. I assumed the doctor was just trying to scare me. But his words, "seriously high," lingered. So I decided to verify it myself. In those days, pharmacies sold urine test strips.

I took the test. The strip turned nearly black. I couldn't believe it. I tested again... and again. The result was the same. It was a shock... but not enough to change me. I was young, and I didn't understand the devastating power of this disease.

So, I continued my life. Two packs of cigarettes a day... and endless nights of drinking with friends. I had no idea that for a diabetic, alcohol is like pouring gasoline on a fire.

My body grew heavier, more tired. It was then that my mother gave me a book.

![A photo of the actual book given by the user's mother 24 years ago, titled 'The Anatomy of Pi-Water' in Korean.](/diabetes-story/3-pi-water-book-the-secret-of-pi-water.jpg "The book my mother gave me, 'The Anatomy of Pi-Water'.")

"Your diabetes is serious," she said. "The book says drinking a lot of this Pi-water can help." I remember feeling irritated. To me, it sounded like a meaningless nag. And the ultimate irony was that we'd had a Pi-water purifier in our home since 1996. "If this water is so great," I retorted, "why did I get diabetes in the first place?"

"You barely drink any," she replied. "You have to drink at least 3 liters... every single day."

I dismissed her. For months, I continued my self-destructive path... until my body began to fail me so completely that I had to make a choice. I was too lazy to exercise and too stubborn to go back to the hospital. "What have I got to lose?" I thought.

I started forcing myself to drink. At least 3 liters. Sometimes 5. After about 20 days, I took out the test strips again. I expected the dark green. But the strip... it remained a pale, unchanged yellow. A visit to the hospital confirmed it: my blood sugar was normal.

And here, I made my greatest mistake... I thought diabetes was a trivial disease. I believed that if my sugar ever got high again, I could just... drink a lot of water. It cemented in my mind a profound and dangerous misunderstanding of my condition.

### Part 2: The Price of Neglect and The Unsung Guardian

That mistake led me on a long, painful rollercoaster. It was a cycle of abuse and recovery that continued until that moment in 2018. It was only after that crisis, when I began to seriously study this disease, that the fragmented memories began to connect... and I had a chilling realization. My symptoms didn't start in my 20s. They had started back in 1993, when I was just a teenager. The constant fatigue, the frequent urination, the heavy-headedness after meals... I had dismissed it all as just part of growing up. My war with diabetes hadn't been for 20-some years. It had been for 30.

Even after narrowly avoiding amputation, my discipline was weak. The photos of my blood sugar readings in 2021 and 2022 show levels near 300. I had quit smoking and drinking, but I couldn't stop the binge-eating.

So what about now? As of two months ago, I finally got serious. I am on a strict, controlled diet. I exercise. And I drink a minimum of 5 liters of Pi-water every single day.

![A recent photo of a blood glucose meter showing a healthy reading of 89 mg/dL.](/diabetes-story/7-normal-fasting-blood-sugar-89-2025.jpg "My fasting blood sugar today, a result of strict discipline.")

The diet and exercise are the foundation. That is the core reason for my current health. But it begs a question... How did I survive those 30 years of reckless living? How did I avoid the worst common diabetic complications: blindness, kidney failure?

I believe the water has been my unsung guardian. Looking back, during the worst moments of my health, I was also the most neglectful in drinking it. In periods of stability, even with a bad diet, I was drinking it more consistently. I believe it was the fuel that allowed my body to endure the decades of damage.

### A Final Thought... A Humble Plea

If you have read this far, you might be thinking, "This man is incredibly stubborn... if he had just trusted the water 20 years ago, he could have avoided all this pain."

You are correct. I was. And my greatest concern is that someone else will waste their golden years making the same mistakes, trapped by their own skepticism.

I have learned, the hard way, that not all water is the same. I believe good water is foundational to health. And the Pi-water I've written about... I believe its value is truly unique. I will be sharing the data and evidence to back this in the stories to come.

I know some will remain skeptical, just as I was for 20 years. To those people, I truly understand. That is why I am preparing these stories with such care. I sincerely hope you don't have to learn through painful experience, as I did. Your health is the most important asset you will ever have. Please... take care of it.
