A quick note: I am not a native English speaker. This story has been crafted with the help of translators and AI to bridge the language gap. If you notice any awkward phrasing or errors, your feedback would be greatly appreciated. The experience, however, is 100% my own.

Do you love Korea? If so, this story might be for you. If not... well, it might just be a curious tale you've never heard before.

Let me be perfectly clear from the start: **This is not a promotion.** It's impossible for it to be. The product I'm about to discuss was officially discontinued in 2023. You can no longer buy it.

So, why am I writing this? Because in a storage container in my main bedroom, I have four unopened boxes of this spirulina. Their expiration date is September 10, 2017. This is the story of why... a story of a hidden gem, a personal journey, and the unfortunate reality of market prejudice.

### Part 1: A Legacy and a Discovery

This story begins long before I truly understood it. Back in May 2006, a notice was posted on a company's mobile app—a platform that, unlike its PC counterpart, still holds these old records. A new spirulina product was being launched.

![A screenshot of the 2006 mobile app notice announcing the launch of the spirulina product, establishing its long history.](/spirulina-story/spirulina-2006-launch-announcement.jpg "The 2006 announcement that started it all.")

Even more remarkable than its long history is this fact: the price listed in that 2006 announcement was the exact same price it sold for until it was discontinued in 2023. It never saw a single price increase.

But my personal journey with it didn't start until around 2011. I knew of it, but I didn't feel a compelling need to take it. Then, one day, I tried it for the first time. Without thinking, I popped the tablets into my mouth and chewed.

Instantly, my mouth was filled with a rich, dark-green paste. The taste was... earthy, dense, and strangely appealing. The texture was even more unique, clinging to my teeth with a sticky chewiness. It reminded me of a nostalgic childhood snack from 1980s Korea called 'Jjondeugi'—a simple, chewy treat that was immensely popular. It was messy, but I found myself reaching for more...

About three or four days later, something unusual happened. I was just absentmindedly rubbing the back of my left hand when I was struck by its texture. It was... soft. Unusually so. The change was so distinct I couldn't immediately place the cause. Then my eyes fell upon the product box on my desk. I read the front label...

"...helps with antioxidant action and **skin health**."

It was a quiet moment of revelation. For me, someone who had been living with diabetes since my teens, a condition that notoriously affects skin health, this felt significant.

But my next thought was a sobering one. "Who would believe this?" In those days, as is often the case around the world, network marketing was viewed with deep suspicion due to the actions of a few unscrupulous companies. In that climate, sharing a story about a product from such a company... it felt like a truth best kept to myself.

### Part 2: A Gem Lost & A Relic in Waiting

I wish I could say that after this discovery, I became a devout daily user. But the truth is more complicated. The chronic fatigue that comes with long-term diabetes was a constant battle, and frankly, my skin wasn't my top priority. So, while I always kept it in the house, my use was sporadic. The social prejudice surrounding its origin was, in a way, a wall that was difficult to climb.

Then, in September 2023, I saw the official notice. It was being discontinued... not because of inventory issues, but because, in a market blinded by prejudice, not enough people were looking for it.

![A screenshot of the official 2023 notice announcing the discontinuation of the spirulina product, showing a different packaging design.](/spirulina-story/official-discontinuation-notice-2023-with-new-packaging.jpg "The End of an Era: The 2023 discontinuation notice. The packaging had changed, but the quality never did.")

It was disheartening. Another brilliant product, vanished. Another gem, known only to a small circle of loyalists, buried by perception. Over the past 30 years, I have seen dozens of world-class products from this one company meet the same fate.

Which brings me back to the four boxes in my main bedroom's storage container. Years ago, a friend of my mother, knowing its value, asked me to purchase them for her. She paid in advance. But life got busy, and she never managed to pick them up. So they sat there, a time capsule from a decade ago, with an expiration date of 2017. They are my physical, constant reminder of this lost treasure.

### A Final Question: Could This Lost Value Be Rediscovered?

I believe this product is proof of a philosophy—that true, undeniable quality can inspire a loyalty that overcomes even the most extreme prejudice. I think it holds a value that people deserve to know about.

This story is my evidence. I've since opened one of the boxes to film its contents, but the others remain... a tangible link to the past.

![A photo of one of the opened bottles, showing the spirulina tablets and the 2017 expiration date on the bottle.](/spirulina-story/unboxed-spirulina-tablets-with-2017-date.jpg "Proof from the past: the tablets and the 2017 date, nearly a decade later.")

As just one consumer, I alone cannot bring this product back. The company will not listen to a single voice. But what if there were thousands of us? What if a global community, united by a belief in true value, asked for its return?

I make no promises. But if **30,000 people** from around the world leave a comment below, expressing their wish to see a product of this caliber revived, I can take that collective voice to the company. It is a difficult challenge, but it is a chance. Because I have learned that while many will buy what is advertised, the wisest among us seek out what is proven.

This is an opportunity for you to be part of that proof.
