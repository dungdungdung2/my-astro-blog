	<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
		<h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600;">Do you love Korea? If so, you've found a story you won't find anywhere else.</h2>
	</div>

	<h1 style="font-size: 2.5rem; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
		What if the greatest products were the ones you've never heard of?
	</h1>

	<p>For nearly 30 years, I have been a consumer of a handful of remarkable Korean products. Products so good, they inspire decades of loyalty without a single ad. Products so misunderstood, they've been silenced by market prejudice.</p>

	<blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1rem; margin-left: 0; font-style: italic;">
				"I've been using only this for over 20 years."<br>
				"A doctor warned of amputation... but this is what happened next."
	</blockquote>

	<p>These are not marketing taglines. They are the beginnings of real storiesâ€”my stories.</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2rem;">KoctoGame is a record of my 27-year experiment in consumption.</h3>

	<p>I am not here to sell you something new. I am here to share a philosophy: that your daily expenses, the money you already spend, can be transformed into your <strong>smartest source of income and well-being.</strong></p>

	<p>This is possible through a combination of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Uncommon Quality:</strong> Discovering products with a level of performance that makes all others obsolete.</li>
		<li><strong>A Fairer System:</strong> Understanding how distribution profits can flow back to you, the consumer.</li>
		<li><strong>Authentic Storytelling:</strong> Learning from real, long-term experiences, not from persuasive ads.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This isn't a complex financial scheme. It's the most common-sense story of changing the way you think about the products already in your home.</p>

	<h3 style="font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2rem; text-align: center;">Ready to question everything you know about value?</h3>
